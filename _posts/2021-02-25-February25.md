I wasn't intending to start a blog, yet here I am. For years I have kept a personal journal where I write about the days events for me and my family. I've also kept professional Lab Notebook---essentially a blog of my professional work as a scientist. This blog comes out of the need to document my personal hobbies, that don't quite fit into what I write in my personal journal. I'll probably be writing about my budding interest in Raspberry Pi and Arduino. We'll see what else I'll write about.

I've chosen to use the nice [minimal-mistakes](https://http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme for my blog. I've been using it for my Lab Notebook and it works rather well.
