- Active participant in [Cross Section Evaluation Working Group (CSEWG)](https://www.nndc.bnl.gov/csewg/) to ensure highest quality nuclear data is available to scientists.
- Led the production of several [nuclear data libraries]({% link _pages/CV/NuclearDataLibraries.md %}) used at LANL and throughout the world.
  

**Postdoc** (August 2009--October 2010)
: Nuclear Nonproliferation Division, Safeguards & Security Group (N-1)
- Principle investigator of the Passive Neutron Albedo Reactivity with Fission Chambers (PNAR-FC) detector.
- Created a Monte Carlo-based method of inferring plutonium content of spent fuel assemblies based upon a few simulations and the input parameters of the detector response and spent fuel assembly characteristics.
- Created a package of Python scripts to facilitate the reading of MCNP input files, extraction of tally results, post-processing of results, and plotting results.
