Jeremy Conlin has led the production of several nuclear data application libraries used at Los Alamos National Laboratory and throughout the world.

Lib80x (2018) 
: Library based [ENDF/B-VIII.0](https://www.nndc.bnl.gov/endf/b8.0/), processed into multigroup-energy and continuous energy application files. This library can be downloaded from the [nuclear data website](https://nucleardata.lanl.gov/ACE/Production/Lib80x.html).

MT71x (2015) 
: Multi-temperature library based on [ENDF/B-VII.1](https://www.nndc.bnl.gov/endf/b7.1), processed into multigroup-energy and continuous energy application files. 

MENDF71x (2014)
: Multigroup-energy application library based on [ENDF/B-VII.1](https://www.nndc.bnl.gov/endf/b7.1).

ENDF71SaB (2013)
: Continuous-representation of *S(α, β)* data for continuous-energy application library based on [ENDF/B-VII.1](https://www.nndc.bnl.gov/endf/b7.1). 

ENDF71x (2013)
: Continuous-energy application library based on [ENDF/B-VII.1](https://www.nndc.bnl.gov/endf/b7.1) suitable for reactor calculations. This library won a Los Alamos Awards Program along with the MCNP6 team.

MENDF70x (2011)
: Multigroup-energy application library based on [ENDF/B-VII.1](https://www.nndc.bnl.gov/endf/b7.0).

Jeremy was also involved in the production of the following libraries.

ENDF80SaB2 (2020)
: Continuous-representation of *S(α, β)* data for continuous-energy application library based on [ENDF/B-VIII.1](https://www.nndc.bnl.gov/endf/b8.0). This library can be downloaded from the [nuclear data website](https://nucleardata.lanl.gov/ACE/Production/Lib80x.html).
