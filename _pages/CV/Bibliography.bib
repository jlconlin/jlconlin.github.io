	abstract = {Very-high-temperature gas-cooled reactors (VHTGRs) are gaining increasing attention due to their technical advantages over light water reactors in terms of intrinsic safety and proliferation-resistant fuel cycle as well as hydrogen production capability. The objective of this paper is to report on the progress of a US/Korea I-NERI research project and address some significant issues and challenges. New advanced computational methods for safety analysis codes for VHTGRs have been developed and numerical and experimental validation of these computer codes was performed\textbf{. }In particular, two well-respected light water reactor transient response codes, RELAP5/ATHENA and MELCOR, were improved in the modeling of molecular diffusion and chemical equilibrium with the aim to validate these codes against the VHTGR accident data, i.e., air ingress and others from the literature. This study consists of five areas: (1) development of computational fluid dynamic methods for VHTGR, (2) experimental study of reactor cavity cooling system, (3) air ingress experiment, (4) theoretical modification of system analysis codes for molecular diffusion (RELAP5/ATHENA) and modeling CO and CO2 equilibrium (MELCOR), (5) development of a state-of-the-art methodology for VHTGR neutronic analysis and calculation of accurate power distributions and decay heat deposition rates.},

@techreport{Conlin_2005Tempe-1,
	abstract = {The current version of MCNP allows the use of physical data libraries generated at
temperatures other than the temperature of the simulation; these simulations must be
questioned as to their validity. The standard MCNP distribution of data libraries is
restricted to a few temperatures because of the size of the data files. Creating new data
libraries at discrete temperatures used to be cumbersome and had to be done manually.
A new code has been developed at LANL to generate new data libraries at arbitrary
temperatures. A Python script to automate the use of this code was developed; a
feature of this script allows the user to obtain equivalent physics at any temperature
with existing data libraries and a Pseudo Material construct. The construct allows
the user to avoid the computational expense and storage space of generating new data
libraries. The Python script was used to facilitate the study of the Doppler defect in
light water reactors.},

	abstract = {A Monte Carlo implementation of explicitly restarted Arnoldi's method is devel- oped for estimating eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the transport-fission operator in the Boltzmann transport equation. Arnoldi's method is an improvement over the power method which has been used for decades. Arnoldi's method can estimate mul- tiple eigenvalues by orthogonalising the resulting fission sources from the application of the transport-fission operator. As part of implementing Arnoldi's method, a solu- tion to the physically impossible---but mathematically real---negative fission sources is developed. The fission source is discretized using a first order accurate spatial approximation to allow for orthogonalization and normalization of the fission source required for Arnoldi's method. The eigenvalue estimates from Arnoldi's method are compared with published results for homogeneous, one-dimensional geometries, and it is found that the eigenvalue and eigenvector estimates are accurate within statistical uncertainty.
The discretization of the fission sources creates an error in the eigenvalue esti- mates. A second order accurate spatial approximation is created to reduce the error in eigenvalue estimates. An inexact application of the transport-fission operator is also investigated to reduce the computational expense of estimating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
The convergence of the fission source and eigenvalue in Arnoldi's method is anal- ysed and compared with the power method. Arnoldi's method is superior to the power method for convergence of the fission source and eigenvalue because both converge nearly instantly for Arnoldi's method while the power method may require hundreds of iterations to converge. This is shown using both homogeneous and heterogeneous one-dimensional geometries with dominance ratios close to 1.},

	abstract = {This poster is one of two complementary posters.     The Next Generation Safeguards Initiative (NGSI) of the U.S. DOE has initiated a multi-lab/university collaboration to quantify the plutonium (Pu) mass in, and detect the diversion of pins from, spent nuclear fuel assemblies with non-destructive assay (NDA). This research effort has the goal of quantifying the capability of 14 NDA techniques as well as training a future generation of safeguards practitioners. By November of 2010, we will be 1.5 years into the first phase (2.5 years) of work. This first phase involves primarily Monte Carlo modelling while the second phase (also 2.5 years) will focus on experimental work. The goal of phase one is to quantify the detection capability of the various techniques for the benefit of safeguard technology developers, regulators, and policy makers as well as to determine what integrated techniques merit experimental work. We are considering a wide range of possible technologies since our research horizon is longer term than the focus of most regulator bodies. The capability of all of the NDA techniques will be determined for a library of 64 17 x 17 PWR assemblies [burnups (15, 30, 45, 60 GWd/tU), initial enrichments (2, 3, 4, 5\%) and cooling times (1, 5, 20, 80 years)]. The burnup and cooling time were simulated with each fuel pin being comprised of four radial regions. In this paper an overview of the purpose will be given as well as a technical update on the following 6 neutron techniques: 252Cf Interrogation with Prompt Neutron Detection, Delayed Neutrons, Differential Die-Away, Differential Die-Away Self-Interrogation, Passive Neutron Albedo Reactivity, Self-Integration Neutron Resonance Densitometry. The technical update will quantify the anticipated performance of each technique for the 64 assemblies of the spent fuel library.},

	abstract = {The combination of Passive Neutron Albedo Reactivity with Fission Chamber (PNAR-FC) and Self-Interrogation Neutron Resonance Densitometry (SINRD) to quantify plutonium content of a spent nuclear fuel assembly was modeled using Monte Carlo N-Particle eXtended (MCNPX) simulations.  Both of these methods rely on neutrons produced by 244Cm in the spent fuel to self interrogate the content of the spent fuel.  PNAR-FC measures the reactivity of the spent fuel assembly, which is a measure of the fissile material inside the assembly of which plutonium is a major component.  SINRD, on the other hand, uses 235U and 239Pu fission chambers to quantify 235U and 239Pu content in the spent fuel by utilizing the same resonance cross sections to amplify (n,f) reaction peaks in the fission chambers.  Using these two techniques should allow for increased precision and accuracy of the plutonium content inside a spent fuel assembly and increased probability of detection of a fuel pin diversion scenario.  This work is funded as part of the Next Generation Safeguards Initiative by the United States Department of Energy and is being executed through several national laboratories and universities inside the United States.},

	abstract = {{Estimating plutonium (Pu) mass in spent nuclear fuel assemblies (SFAs)
   helps inspectors ensure that no Pu is diverted. Therefore,
   nondestructive assay (NDA) methods are being developed to assay Pu mass
   in SFAs. Uncertainty quantification is an important task in most assay
   methods, and particularly for SFA assay. A computer model (MCNPX) is
   being used to predict isotope masses and the spatial distribution of
   masses in virtual SFAs for 64 combinations of initial fuel enrichment
   (IE), fuel utilization {[}burnup (BU)], and cooling time (CT) values.
   Additional MCNPX modeling for the same 64 virtual SFAs provided the
   expected detector responses (DRs) for several NDA techniques such as the
   passive neutron albedo reactivity method and the Cf-252 interrogation
   with prompt neutrons method.
   A previous paper describes one uncertainty quantification approach
   involving Monte Carlo (MC) simulation using individually any of six new
   NDA options together with IE, BU, and CT. This paper provides an
   interpretation of the MC approach that is suited for a numerical
   Bayesian alternative. separately assesses the impact of MCNPX
   interpolation error, and compares several options to use subsets of IE,
   BU, CT, and one DR.}},

handled by the RECONR module. It is used to reconstruct resonance cross sections from
resonance parameters and to reconstruct cross sections from ENDF nonlinear interpolation
schemes. Cross sections are then evaluated on a common energy grid and redundant cross
sections are determined from their components. The RECONR module is the first module being
modernized under the NJOY21 project. In this paper we will provide an overview of the current
status of the modernization of this module. In particular, we will present the first results for the
new R-Matrix limited (RML) resonance reconstruction capability provided by NJOY21.},

@article{Sublet_2019Neutr-2,
	abstract = {Nuclear interactions can be the source of atomic displacement and post-short-term cascade annealing defects in irradiated structural materials. Such quantities are derived from, or can be correlated to, nuclear kinematic simulations of primary atomic energy distributions spectra and the quantification of the numbers of secondary defects produced per primary as a function of the available recoils, residual and emitted, energies. Recoils kinematics of neutral, residual, charged and multi-particle emissions are now more rigorously treated based on modern, complete and enhanced nuclear data parsed in state of the art processing tools. Defect production metrics are the starting point in this complex problem of correlating and simulating the behaviour of materials under irradiation, as direct measurements are extremely improbable. The multi-scale dimensions (nuclear-atomic-molecular-material) of the simulation process is tackled from the Fermi gradation to provide the atomic- and meso-scale dimensions with better metrics relying upon a deeper understanding and modelling capabilities of the nuclear level. Detailed, segregated primary knock-on-atom metrics are now available as the starting point of further simulation processes of isolated and clustered defects in material lattices. This allows more materials, incident energy ranges and particles, and irradiations conditions to be explored, with sufficient data to adequately cover both standard applications and novel ones, such as advanced-fission, accelerators, nuclear medicine, space and fusion. This paper reviews the theory, describes the latest methodologies and metrics, and provides recommendations for standard and novel approaches.},
